### Hello 🙋‍♂️, Thanks for visiting!
## About me
I'm a software engineer from Adelaide Australia.
- 🔭 Currently working on a whistle blowing web app.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure & Terraform. Been very impressed with Terraform as of late.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huydo1999/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/huy.do.315/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My profile picture is a section of the [Mandlebrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). I think it's a good example of what computing allows us to do.
- 🏡 As of late, outside of work I've been gymming, been interested in cocktails, and been taking my first steps toward github contributions
