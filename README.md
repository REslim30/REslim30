### Hello 🙋‍♂️, Thanks for visiting!
## About me
I'm a software engineer from Adelaide Australia.
- 🔭 Currently working on a whistle blowing web app.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure & Terraform. Been very impressed with Terraform as of late.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huydo1999/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/huy.do.315/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My profile picture is a section of the [Mandlebrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). I think it's a good example of what computing allows us to do.
- 🏡 As of late, outside of work I've been gymming, been interested in cocktails, and been taking my first steps toward github contributions.

## Repositories
I've mainly used GitHub as a place to store university work and also some personal projects. Let me give you a **run down my main repositories:**

#### Palette Pal
This is a web-app built in React and Express.js that helps web developers store their color palettes online. This is the [frontend](https://github.com/REslim30/palette-pal-frontend), this is the [backend](https://github.com/REslim30/palette-pal-backend) and you can visit the site [here](https://palettepal.tech/).

#### selector-describer
This is a web-app built in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript that describes selectors in plain english. Here's the [repo](https://github.com/REslim30/selector-describer) and here's the [site](http://describe-your-selector.netlify.app/).

#### ATOMfeeds
This is an ATOM syndication system which is just a fancier version of RSS. It includes a server, a content server and a client built in Java. It's pretty low level so you're not going to find any nice UI here. This was for a 3rd year university course about distributed systems. If you're interested in the code, here's the [repo](https://github.com/REslim30/ATOMfeeds).

#### paxos
This is a paxos simulator which is an algorithm that gets many servers to all agree on a single value - which at the outset seems simple but there's a lot of gotchas. It's built in Java and was for a 3rd year university course about distributed systems. If you're interested in the code, here's the [repo](https://github.com/REslim30/paxos)

#### Event Driven Tag
This is a multiplayer game of tag of up to 5 players built in Cordova, sockets.io and Rxjs. This was for a 3rd year university course about event driven computing. It was my first taste of using Rxjs and using finite state machines in a real application. This is the [frontend](https://github.com/REslim30/event-driven-tag-frontend) and this is the [backend](https://github.com/REslim30/event-driven-tag-backend).
