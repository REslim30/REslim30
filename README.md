### Hello 🙋‍♂️, Thanks for visiting!
I'm Aidan, a software engineer from Adelaide Australia.
- 🔭 Currently working on a whistle blowing web app for NQRY.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure & Terraform. Been very impressed with Terraform as of late.
- 🤔 Also currently looking into how terminal emulators work. Still don't understand pseudo ttys haha.
- 📫 Feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huydo1999/), or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/huy.do.315/). Always on the lookout for new people to meet, cool projects to work on, and new job opportunities :). Or maybe you could explain to me how psuedo ttys work haha.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My profile picture is a section of the [Mandlebrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
- 🏡 As of late, outside of work I've been gymming, learning how to make cocktails, and been taking my first steps toward github contributions.
